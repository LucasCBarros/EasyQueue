# MegaDevs
Project: FilaFacil

The project follows the MVC architecture

**Infos:**
- The Firebase database needs to be remade, we were meaning to implement and iCloud backend in the future.
- The Firebase was also responsible for the user authentication.
- All the data is persisted using the DAO.
- The project also has a TvOS and WatchOS target to support the iOS app. 
  - The TvOS is a board that displays all the informations in run time.
  - The WatchOS was implemented to help the instructores receive notification about the questions.
- The Project is based in storyboards but separated in diferent files to reduce conflicts.
- We began making unit Tests but didn't continue the implementation.
- We were going to work on localizable strings to take the project to other Apple Developer Academies in the future.
- We tried keeping all the code and commentaries in english (But if there is anything that need better translation, contact us)
