## Description
An iOS App that extends from iOS to TvOS and WatchOS to optimize the user experience while sharing they dificulties with the team. This tool makes overcoming & learning challenges easier with team effort, where everyone can give support.

## About

The application evolved into an internal tool for the Apple Developer Academy at Eldorado, enhancing flexibility and agility within the learning process. Additionally, we showcased the project at the Mobile Campus hackathon, competing for "best learning solution".

### Technical Overview

- The information is saved in Firebase where we store user data as JSON and images
- The data is persisted using the DAO.
- The authentication is also using Firebase
- We opted a simple MVC Architecture
- There is a separate target for TvOS and another for WatchOS
- Swift version: 3.0

### Known Issues & Improvements: 

- Firebase needs to be reconfigured (We had plans to re-implement the BE using iCloud)
- The Project uses storyboards but separated in different files to reduce conflicts.
- The Unit Tests still have very low coverage.
- We had plans to work on the localizable strings to make the project more accessible.
- We tried keeping all the code and commentaries in english (But there might be something still in portugues, feel free to contact me)
